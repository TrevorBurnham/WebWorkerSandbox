# Web Worker Sandbox

A testing ground for [Web Workers](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/), created for the book *[Async JavaScript](http://leanpub.com/asyncjs/)*.

Plug in your master script and your worker script, then click **Run**. When you've got something you want to show off, just share the link.

## How does it work?

When you click **Run**, the two scripts are `POST`ed to the server and saved, and you're redirected to a URL containing the ID of the database entry.

When that URL is requested, the server sets a cookie containing that ID, so that when

    new Worker('worker.js')

runs from the master script, that cookie is sent with the requestâ€”allowing the server to serve the right `worker.js` for the page.

## Forking

To run your own Web Worker Sandbox, all you have to do is clone the repo, install Node 0.6.x, run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies, and create a `mongodb.json` file in this format:

    {
      "username": "username",
      "password": "password",
      "address":  "foo.bar.com:port",
      "db":       "dbname"
    }

Pull requests welcome!
